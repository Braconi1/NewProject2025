Introduction

Aventus Perfumery is an online platform designed to elegantly and efficiently showcase and sell luxury perfumes.

The goal of the project was to utilize technologies like HTML, CSS, and Java to build a web application that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.

Project Components

Contact Page

The contact page is one of the core features of this platform. It allows users to reach out to customer support through a form where they can enter essential details such as name, email address, phone number, and message. Additionally, the page provides basic contact information like the company's address and phone number.

A modal window was implemented to confirm successful message submission, enhancing the user experience. The form design is responsive, ensuring compatibility across all devices​(contact).

User Registration

The registration page enables users to create accounts. The form includes fields for name, email, password, date of birth, gender, phone number, address, and an option to upload a profile picture. Input validation is mandatory, ensuring accurate data entry during the registration process.

The registration form sends data to the server using the POST method, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server​.

Products Page

The products page is a key section of the project, offering a rich visual display of the perfume collection. Products are categorized by brand, and each one is accompanied by a visual representation and essential details. A table with detailed product information—including season suitability, type (niche or regular), price, and rating—was added to make selection easier for users.


The visual presentation helps users quickly find what suits their preferences, while a promotional video adds a dynamic and professional touch to the page​.

Technologies Used

HTML was used to structure the pages, while CSS was employed to style and create an attractive user interface. The design is responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

Java and API Integration
APIs facilitate the transmission of data entered in the contact and registration forms to the server, enabling fast processing of user requests. JavaScript was utilized to implement interactive elements like modal windows, input validation, and a geolocation API on the contact page.

Bootstrap compoments were used also, to insure contact modal and icons to the project requirment.

Navigation: The main menu enables easy navigation between pages—Home, Products, Login, and Contact.
